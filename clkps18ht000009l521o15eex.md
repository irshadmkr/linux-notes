1. What is VMWare Horizon?
    
    * Software used to implement Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Remote Desktop solutions.
        
    * Licensed by VMWare, which offers a wide range of Virtualization, cloud solutions.
        
    * Key Features: Centralized management, flexibility, personalization, security and High Performance.
        
2. Defining the Architecture!
    
    * Think of VMware Horizon architecture as the blueprint or plan for how VMware Horizon works to give you a virtual desktop experience. It's like building a house, and each component plays a specific role to make it all work smoothly.
        
    * Key Components: Horizon Client, Connection Server, Agent, vSphere ESXi, Desktop pools, Application pools, Horizon Composer, Load Balancer, Gateway and Database.

3. System Requirements for VMWare Horizon Implementation?
    
    * As per [VMWare's Official Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2111/horizon-installation/GUID-332CFB83-784A-4578-9354-888C0538909A.html), the deployment varies depending on factors such as the scale of deployment, the number of users, and the desired performance level. However, the requirement for each component is as follows:
        
    * VMware vSphere (Virtualization Platform):
        
        * Server Hardware: One or two servers with dual or quad-core CPUs, 32 GB to 64 GB of RAM, and sufficient storage capacity (e.g., 1 TB or more).
            
        * Network: Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for data transfer between virtual machines and users.
            
    * Horizon Connection Server:
        
        * Server Hardware: A dedicated server or virtual machine with a dual-core CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and moderate storage capacity (e.g., 100 GB).
            
        * Operating System: Windows Server 2016/2019.
            
    * Horizon Desktop Virtual Machines:
        
        * Virtual Machine Hardware: For each virtual desktop, allocate 2 to 4 CPU cores, 8 GB to 16 GB of RAM, and enough storage for the operating system and applications (e.g., 50 GB to 100 GB per desktop).
            
    * Unified Access Gateway (UAG) (Optional for external access):
        
        * Server Hardware: A dedicated server or virtual machine with a dual-core CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and moderate storage capacity (e.g., 100 GB).
            
    * Networking:
        
        * Network Bandwidth: A minimum of 1 Gbps network connectivity between users and the virtual desktops/applications.
            
    * Load Balancer (Optional):
        
        * A basic load balancer can be used to distribute user connections if you have multiple Connection Servers.
            

## Installation Steps:

For the most accurate and up-to-date step-by-step implementation procedure of VMware Horizon, I recommend watching the YouTube playlist provided by "[**Labs Hands On**](https://www.youtube.com/@LabsHandsOn)**".** These videos can guide you through the entire installation process and offer valuable insights into configuring VMware Horizon components to suit your specific requirements.

        ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-69.png align="left")
        
    
5. Configure Horizon Connection Server:
    
    * After installation, access the Horizon Administrator console to configure the server settings, license, and SSL certificates.
        
    * Configure Active Directory integration for user authentication.
        
    * Create desktop and application pools and define entitlements for user access.
        
    * ### **Horizon Console Certificate Management**
        
        Horizon 2212 and newer have a **Certificate Management** section in the Horizon Console under **Settings**.
        
        ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-20.png align="left")
        
        * The **administrator's** role in Horizon does not include Certificate **Management** permission. Go to **Settings** &gt; **Administrators**. On the right, switch to the tab named **Role Privileges**. Click **Add**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-21.png align="left")
            
        * Name the role CertificateManagement or similar. Select the **Manage Certificates** privilege and click **OK**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-24.png align="left")
            
        * Switch to the tab named **Administrators and Groups**. Select your Horizon Admins group and click **Add Permissions**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-25.png align="left")
            
        * Select your new CertificateManagement role and click **Finish**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-26.png align="left")
            
        * If you log out, log back in, and then go to **Settings** &gt; **Certificate Management**, the buttons should no longer be grayed out. You can either import an existing cert, or click **Generate CSR** to create a new cert. If you click **Generate CSR**, then there’s no way to use this interface to combine the signed certificate with the key, so it’s probably better to use some other method of creating a certificate and export it as a .pfx file.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-27.png align="left")
            
        * Click **Import** to upload a PFX file to the Connection Server that you are currently connected to. You’ll have to repeat this process on each Connection Server.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-31.png align="left")
            
        * In **certlm.msc** on the Connection Server, notice that it sets the **vdm** friendly name on the imported cert, but it doesn’t remove the **vdm** friendly name from the old cert. You’ll need to manually remove the **vdm** friendly name from the old cert.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-32.png align="left")
            
        * Then open **services.msc** and restart the **VMware Horizon View Security Gateway Component**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-33.png align="left")
            
        * Repeat this process on the other Connection Servers.
            
        
6. Install Horizon Agent:
    
    * Install the Horizon Agent on each virtual machine that will host virtual desktops or applications.
        
    * Customize the Horizon Agent settings according to your requirements.
        
        **Horizon Agent Installation/Upgrade**
        
        Install Horizon Agent on the master virtual desktop. Upgrades are performed in place.
        
        * See VMware 2149393 [Supported versions of Windows 10 on Horizon Agent](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2149393).
            
        * Windows 10 version 1903 is supported by Horizon Agent 7.8 and newer.
            
            Windows 10 version 1809 is supported by Horizon Agents 7.5.1 and newer.
            
        * **VMware Tools** – Only install Horizon Agent after you install VMware Tools.
            
            * If you need to update VMware Tools, uninstall Horizon Agent, upgrade VMware Tools, and then reinstall Horizon Agent.
                
            * See [VMware Product Interoperability Matrices](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&23=&139=) for supported versions of VMware Tools with different versions of Horizon Agent.
                
            * If VMware Tools 11.x, VMware recommends running the following: (source = VMware 78434 [Performance issues for Horizon 7 when using VMware VMTools 11.x](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78434))

## **VMware Horizon Interview Questions and Answers**

Here are 20 commonly asked VMware Horizon interview questions and answers to prepare you for your interview:

#### **1\. What is VMware Horizon?**

VMware Horizon is a virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) solution that allows users to access their desktops and applications from anywhere, at any time, and from any device. It is a complete end-to-end solution that includes everything you need to deploy and manage a virtual desktop infrastructure, including a connection server, virtual desktop agents, a security server, and a management server.

#### **2\. Can you explain the difference between VMware Horizon and other VDI solutions like Citrix XenApp or XenDesktop?**

VMware Horizon is a VDI solution that offers a complete virtual desktop infrastructure, from the desktop images and applications down to the networking and storage infrastructure. This means that it is a complete solution that can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud. Other VDI solutions, like Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop, focus on delivering desktop images and applications but do not include the infrastructure components. This means that they must be deployed on top of an existing infrastructure, which can add complexity and cost.

#### **3\. How can you use VMware Horizon to enable a user to access their desktop from anywhere in the world?**

VMware Horizon can be used to enable a user to access their desktop from anywhere in the world by creating a secure, remote connection to the desktop. This remote connection can be accessed from any internet-connected device, making it possible for users to work from anywhere.

#### **4\. What are some of the unique features offered by VMware Horizon?**

VMware Horizon offers a few features that are unique among virtual desktop solutions. One is its Instant Clone feature, which allows for the creation of new virtual machines in seconds. It also offers a feature called Project A2D, which allows for the creation of virtual machines that are compatible with Android devices.

#### **5\. How do you troubleshoot an issue with View Composer agent initialization state error when using VMware Horizon?**

There are a few things that you can check when you run into this issue:

1\. Make sure that the View Composer service is running on the server.  
2\. Check the View Composer log files for any errors.  
3\. Try restarting the View Composer service.  
4\. If you are still having issues, you can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the View Composer agent.

#### **6\. What’s the best way to resolve issues with Windows updates failing after installing the VMware horizon agent on your virtual machine?**

The best way to resolve this issue is to uninstall the VMware Horizon agent, and then try installing the Windows updates again. If that doesn’t work, you may need to contact Microsoft support for help with troubleshooting the Windows update issue.

#### **7\. Can you explain what PCoIP is as it relates to VMware Horizon?**

PCoIP is a display protocol designed specifically for virtual desktop environments. It is optimized to deliver a high-quality user experience even over low-bandwidth or high-latency networks. PCoIP is used by VMware Horizon to provide users with a rich, responsive desktop experience from anywhere.

#### **8\. What are some common questions asked about implementing VMware Horizon for our organization?**

1\. What are the business goals that you are hoping to achieve by implementing VMware Horizon?  
2\. What are the specific technical requirements of your organization that need to be met for VMware Horizon to be successfully implemented?  
3\. What is the timeline for implementing VMware Horizon in your organization?  
4\. What is the budget for implementing VMware Horizon in your organization?  
5\. What are the risks and challenges associated with implementing VMware Horizon in your organization?

#### **9\. What are some challenges faced by organizations when trying to implement VMware Horizon?**

One challenge that can be faced when implementing VMware Horizon is ensuring that the correct permissions are in place for users to access the system. Another challenge can be ensuring that the system is properly configured to meet the needs of the organization.

#### **10\. Do you need to install additional software for users to connect to Horizon through HTML Access? If yes, then why?**

No, you don’t need to install any additional software for users to connect to Horizon through HTML Access. The reason for this is that HTML Access uses standard web technologies that are already built into most web browsers.

#### **11\. What happens if someone tries to add a vGPU-enabled VM to a pool that doesn’t have a GPU profile assigned?**

If someone tries to add a vGPU-enabled VM to a pool that doesn’t have a GPU profile assigned, the VM will not be able to start up. A GPU profile must be assigned to the pool for any vGPU-enabled VMs to be able to run on that pool.

#### **12\. How does VMware Horizon help reduce TCO (total cost of ownership) for IT infrastructure?**

VMware Horizon helps reduce TCO for IT infrastructure by simplifying the management and deployment of virtual desktops and apps. It also helps reduce the need for physical hardware, which can save on energy and maintenance costs.

#### **13\. Can you explain how cloning works in VMware Horizon?**

When you clone a desktop in VMware Horizon, you are essentially creating an identical copy of the original desktop. This can be useful if you need to create multiple identical desktops, or if you want to create a backup in case something goes wrong with the original. To clone a desktop, you will first need to create a master image of the desktop that you want to clone. Once you have the master image, you can then use it to create as many clones as you need.

#### **14\. Is it possible to create linked clones without vCenter Server? If yes, then how?**

Yes, it is possible to create linked clones without vCenter Server, but you will need to use the VMware Horizon Client instead. To do this, you will need to first create a full clone of the parent VM. Once the full clone has been created, you can then use the Horizon Client to create linked clones from the full clone.

#### **15\. What version of View Composer needs to be installed on the vCenter server before creating linked clones?**

View Composer 2.7

#### **16\. What are the different types of provisioning methods available in VMware Horizon?**

The three types of provisioning methods available in VMware Horizon are manual provisioning, linked-clone provisioning, and full-clone provisioning.

#### **17\. What is a floating entitlement license?**

A floating entitlement license allows a user to access a VMware Horizon virtual desktop from any device, as long as the device is connected to the network. The user is not tied to any specific device and can move from device to device as needed.

#### **18\. What is the maximum number of desktops that can be delivered per connection server instance?**

The maximum number of desktops that can be delivered per connection server instance is 1,000.

#### **19\. What does the “Add Desktop” button do in a deployment wizard?**

The “Add Desktop” button in a deployment wizard allows you to add a desktop to the deployment. This is useful if you want to have multiple desktops in the same deployment, or if you want to add a desktop to an existing deployment.

#### **20\. Is it possible to clone multiple desktops simultaneously within one step? If yes, then how?**

Yes, it is possible to clone multiple desktops simultaneously within one step by using the VMware Horizon View Composer. This feature allows you to quickly create multiple copies of a desktop, which can be useful when you need to deploy a large number of desktops quickly.
