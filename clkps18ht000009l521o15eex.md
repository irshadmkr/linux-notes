1. What is VMWare Horizon?
    
    * Software used to implement Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and Remote Desktop solutions.
        
    * Licensed by VMWare, which offers a wide range of Virtualization, cloud solutions.
        
    * Key Features: Centralized management, flexibility, personalization, security and High Performance.
        
2. Defining the Architecture!
    
    * Think of VMware Horizon architecture as the blueprint or plan for how VMware Horizon works to give you a virtual desktop experience. It's like building a house, and each component plays a specific role to make it all work smoothly.
        
    * Key Components: Horizon Client, Connection Server, Agent, vSphere ESXi, Desktop pools, Application pools, Horizon Composer, Load Balancer, Gateway and Database.

3. System Requirements for VMWare Horizon Implementation?
    
    * As per [VMWare's Official Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2111/horizon-installation/GUID-332CFB83-784A-4578-9354-888C0538909A.html), the deployment varies depending on factors such as the scale of deployment, the number of users, and the desired performance level. However, the requirement for each component is as follows:
        
    * VMware vSphere (Virtualization Platform):
        
        * Server Hardware: One or two servers with dual or quad-core CPUs, 32 GB to 64 GB of RAM, and sufficient storage capacity (e.g., 1 TB or more).
            
        * Network: Gigabit Ethernet connectivity for data transfer between virtual machines and users.
            
    * Horizon Connection Server:
        
        * Server Hardware: A dedicated server or virtual machine with a dual-core CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and moderate storage capacity (e.g., 100 GB).
            
        * Operating System: Windows Server 2016/2019.
            
    * Horizon Desktop Virtual Machines:
        
        * Virtual Machine Hardware: For each virtual desktop, allocate 2 to 4 CPU cores, 8 GB to 16 GB of RAM, and enough storage for the operating system and applications (e.g., 50 GB to 100 GB per desktop).
            
    * Unified Access Gateway (UAG) (Optional for external access):
        
        * Server Hardware: A dedicated server or virtual machine with a dual-core CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and moderate storage capacity (e.g., 100 GB).
            
    * Networking:
        
        * Network Bandwidth: A minimum of 1 Gbps network connectivity between users and the virtual desktops/applications.
            
    * Load Balancer (Optional):
        
        * A basic load balancer can be used to distribute user connections if you have multiple Connection Servers.
            

## Installation Steps:

1. Prepare the Environment:
    
    * Ensure that your hardware meets the minimum system requirements for the VMware vSphere (virtualization platform), Horizon Connection Server, and any additional components you plan to deploy.
        
    * Install and configure the necessary operating systems and networking components.
        
2. Deploy VMware vSphere:
    
    * Install and configure VMware vSphere on your physical servers or virtualization hosts. Create a virtual machine for the Horizon Connection Server and additional virtual machines for virtual desktops (or use linked clones if utilizing Horizon Composer).
        
    * ![First install and setup at least one ESXi host, then deploy or install vCenter Server.](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.install.doc/images/GUID-5FE2EE35-63AD-4EA4-8C02-15E4407DB135-high.png align="left")
        
3. Install Horizon Connection Server:

4. ### **Install Horizon Connection Server Replica**
    
    Additional Horizon Connection Servers are installed as Replicas. After installation, there is no difference between a Replica server and a Standard server.
    
    A production Horizon Connection Server should have 10 GB of RAM and 4 vCPU.
    
    To install Horizon Connection Server Replica:
    
    * Ensure the Horizon Connection Server has 10 GB of RAM and 4 vCPU. Source = [Hardware Requirements for Horizon Connection Server](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Horizon/2303/horizon-installation/GUID-332CFB83-784A-4578-9354-888C0538909A.html) at VMware Docs.

        ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-69.png align="left")
        
    
5. Configure Horizon Connection Server:
    
    * After installation, access the Horizon Administrator console to configure the server settings, license, and SSL certificates.
        
    * Configure Active Directory integration for user authentication.
        
    * Create desktop and application pools and define entitlements for user access.
        
    * ### **Horizon Console Certificate Management**
        
        Horizon 2212 and newer have a **Certificate Management** section in the Horizon Console under **Settings**.
        
        ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-20.png align="left")
        
        * The **Administrators** role in Horizon does not include the **Certificate Management** permission. Go to **Settings** &gt; **Administrators**. On the right, switch to the tab named **Role Privileges**. Click **Add**.  
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-21.png align="left")
            
        * Name the role CertificateManagement or similar. Select the **Manage Certificates** privilege and click **OK**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-24.png align="left")
            
        * Switch to the tab named **Administrators and Groups**. Select your Horizon Admins group and click **Add Permissions**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-25.png align="left")
            
        * Select your new CertificateManagement role and click **Finish**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-26.png align="left")
            
        * If you log out, log back in, and then go to **Settings** &gt; **Certificate Management**, the buttons should no longer be grayed out. You can either import an existing cert, or click **Generate CSR** to create a new cert. If you click **Generate CSR**, then there’s no way to use this interface to combine the signed certificate with the key, so it’s probably better to use some other method of creating a certificate and export it as a .pfx file.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-27.png align="left")
            
        * Click **Import** to upload a PFX file to the Connection Server that you are currently connected to. You’ll have to repeat this process on each Connection Server.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-31.png align="left")
            
        * In **certlm.msc** on the Connection Server, notice that it sets the **vdm** friendly name on the imported cert, but it doesn’t remove the **vdm** friendly name from the old cert. You’ll need to manually remove the **vdm** friendly name from the old cert.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-32.png align="left")
            
        * Then open **services.msc** and restart the **VMware Horizon View Security Gateway Component**.
            
            ![](https://www.carlstalhood.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pasted-33.png align="left")
            
        * Repeat this process on the other Connection Servers.
            
        
6. Install Horizon Agent:
    
    * Install the Horizon Agent on each virtual machine that will host virtual desktops or applications.
        
    * Customize the Horizon Agent settings according to your requirements.
        
7. Set up Unified Access Gateway (UAG) (Optional for external access):
    
    * Install and configure the Unified Access Gateway if you need to provide secure external access to virtual desktops and applications.
        
8. Load Balancer Configuration (Optional):
    
    * If deploying multiple Connection Servers for high availability or load balancing, configure your load balancer to distribute user connections.
        
9. Testing and Optimization:
    
    * Conduct thorough testing to ensure that the Horizon environment is functioning correctly and meeting performance expectations.
        
    * Optimize and fine-tune settings for better performance and user experience.
        
10. Client Installation:
    
    * Install the VMware Horizon Client on end-user devices to enable them to access virtual desktops and applications.
