What is OSI Model?

OSI Stands for Open Systems Interconnection, developed to help computers communicate with each other. There are 7 layers

**Layer-1 Devices**: Modem, Hub (No longer used)

**Modem**: Provides single connection and connected with Wires

**Hub**: Repeater (replicates signals to all the ports)

**Layer-2 Devices**: Switch, Wireless Access Point Switch:

Both can be programmed to learn when a device is on the network and which ports it is connected to using MAC. Only communicates with the LAN Devices.

**Layer-3 Devices**: MLS(Multilayer L3 Switch), Router

**MLS Switch**: Can be programmed to handle routing functions. Devices connected can communicate with non-LAN Devices

**Router**: Uses Software Programming to keep track of different networks and routes to reach those networks. Can communicate with both Local and Non-LAN Devices.
